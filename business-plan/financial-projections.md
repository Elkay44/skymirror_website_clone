## 11) Notes & Governance
- All figures are directional and for planning; update quarterly with actuals.
- Consolidate pilot learnings into pricing & discount policy by end of Yr1.
- Move from project-heavy mix to higher SaaS mix by Yr3 for margin expansion.
- Prepare for limited assurance review before external fundraising.
