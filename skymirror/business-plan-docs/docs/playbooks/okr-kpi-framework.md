# Skymirror OKR & KPI Framework

## Executive Summary

This document establishes Skymirror's Objectives and Key Results (OKR) framework and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). It provides the methodology, templates, and governance for setting, tracking, and achieving company goals across all business units: **Software Solutions**, **AI Applications (CheckMet, Traquiva)**, and **Skymirror Academy**.

## Part 1: OKR Framework

### 1.1 OKR Methodology

**What are OKRs?**
- **Objectives**: Qualitative, inspiring goals that define what we want to achieve
- **Key Results**: Quantitative, measurable outcomes that indicate progress toward objectives

**OKR Principles at Skymirror:**
1. **Ambitious**: Objectives should stretch the team (70% achievement = success)
2. **Aligned**: All OKRs cascade from company objectives
3. **Transparent**: All OKRs visible to entire organization
4. **Time-bound**: Quarterly cycles with annual themes
5. **Limited**: Maximum 3-5 objectives per level, 3-5 key results per objective

### 1.2 OKR Hierarchy
