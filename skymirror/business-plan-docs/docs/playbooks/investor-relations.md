---

## Part 1: Investor Story & Narrative

### 1.1 The SkyMirror Investment Thesis

**One-Liner:**
> SkyMirror is building an integrated technology ecosystem for enterprise workforce management and education, powered by AI applications (CheckMet, Traquiva), custom software solutions, and SkyMirror Academy.

**Elevator Pitch (30 seconds):**
> Every year, enterprises lose billions to time fraud, manual errors, and compliance failures in workforce management, while facing critical skills gaps. SkyMirror addresses both with CheckMet (AI attendance), Traquiva (AI learning platform), custom software solutions, and SkyMirror Academy. We're already deployed with paying customers across Europe, growing 100%+ quarter-over-quarter, with a clear path to €5M ARR. We're raising €5M to accelerate product development and expand across Europe.

**Full Pitch (2 minutes):**

**The Problem:**
Enterprise workforce management is broken. Companies with 500+ employees spend €200K+ annually on attendance administration, yet still face:
- 5-10% payroll errors from manual tracking
- €50K+ annual losses from time fraud
- Compliance risks from inadequate documentation
- Zero real-time visibility into workforce

**The Solution:**
CheckMet is an AI-powered attendance platform that:
- Achieves 99.9% recognition accuracy (vs. 85% industry average)
- Reduces admin time by 95%
- Integrates with 50+ HRIS/payroll systems
- Provides real-time workforce analytics

**Traction:**
- €183K ARR with 8 enterprise customers
- 1,750 active users across 3 countries
- 98% customer retention
- 40+ NPS score

**Market:**
- €15B TAM in enterprise workforce management
- 25% CAGR in AI-powered HR solutions
- Regulatory tailwinds (GDPR, labor compliance)

**Team:**
- CEO Lukman: 10+ years enterprise software, ex-[Company]
- CTO Eric: AI/ML expert, 3 patents, ex-[Company]
- COO Dr. Loveday: Operations leader, scaled teams to 500+

**The Ask:**
Raising €5M Series A to:
- Expand engineering team (40%)
- Accelerate European expansion (35%)
- Scale sales & marketing (25%)

**Why Now:**
- Post-COVID shift to hybrid work creates urgency
- AI technology finally mature enough for enterprise
- First-mover advantage in European market
