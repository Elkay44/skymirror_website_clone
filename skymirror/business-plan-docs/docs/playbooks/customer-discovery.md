## Part 4: Market Sizing

### 4.1 Bottom-Up Market Sizing

#### TAM Calculation

```
Total Addressable Market (TAM)
= Total enterprises globally × % with attendance needs × Average deal size

= €20 billion
```

#### SAM Calculation

```
Serviceable Available Market (SAM)
= TAM × % in target geography × % in target industries

```

#### SOM Calculation

```
Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)
