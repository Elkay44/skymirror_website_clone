## Program Philosophy

### Our Approach
We believe in **learning by building**. Interns don't work on toy projects—they ship real features to production, contribute to actual products, and experience the full software development lifecycle.

### Core Principles
1. **Real Impact** - Every intern ships production code
2. **Structured Learning** - Balanced curriculum with hands-on application
3. **Professional Standards** - Fortune 50-level processes and quality
4. **Mentorship First** - Every intern has a dedicated technical mentor
5. **Growth Mindset** - Focus on learning, not perfection
