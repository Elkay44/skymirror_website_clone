## Mentorship Model

### Philosophy

**Our Mentorship Approach:**
- **Guide, don't solve** - Help interns find answers, don't give them
- **Teach to fish** - Build problem-solving skills, not dependency
- **Safe to fail** - Create environment where mistakes are learning opportunities
- **Growth mindset** - Focus on progress, not perfection
- **Individual attention** - Each intern is unique with different needs

### Mentor-Intern Ratio

**1:1 Assignment**
- Each intern has one primary mentor
- Mentor is a senior engineer (3+ years experience)
- Backup mentor assigned for coverage
- Access to entire team for questions

- ✅ Take notes on key points
- ✅ Follow up on previous action items
- ✅ End with clear next steps

**For Interns:**
- ✅ Come prepared with questions
- ✅ Share challenges openly
- ✅ Ask for specific feedback
- ✅ Take notes
- ✅ Be honest about struggles
- ✅ Suggest topics to discuss

### Sample Questions

**Progress Questions:**
- "What are you most proud of this week?"
- "What was the biggest challenge you faced?"
- "What would you do differently next time?"

**Technical Questions:**
- "Can you walk me through your approach to [problem]?"
- "What did you learn from the code review feedback?"
- "What part of the codebase is still unclear?"

**Growth Questions:**
- "What skill do you want to develop next?"
- "What type of work energizes you?"
- "Where do you want to be in 6 months?"

## Feedback Best Practices

### Giving Effective Feedback

#### The SBI Model

**Situation - Behavior - Impact**

**Example:**
```
Situation: "In yesterday's code review..."
Behavior: "...you explained your architectural decision clearly..."
Impact: "...which helped the team understand the trade-offs and approve the PR quickly."
```

#### Positive Feedback

**Do:**
- Be specific and timely
- Explain why it matters
- Encourage repetition
- Celebrate publicly (if appropriate)

**Example:**
```
✅ "Your PR description for the auth feature was excellent. You included:
   - Clear problem statement
   - Implementation approach
   - Testing steps
   - Screenshots
   
   This made review much faster and shows great communication skills.
   Keep doing this!"
```

#### Constructive Feedback

**Do:**
- Focus on behavior, not person
- Be specific with examples
- Suggest improvements
- Offer support

**Don't:**
- Be vague ("your code needs work")
- Make it personal ("you're not good at...")
- Only criticize without solutions
- Give feedback publicly (unless minor)

**Example:**
```
✅ "I noticed in the last few PRs, some edge cases weren't handled:
   - Null checks missing in user.service.ts
   - Empty array not handled in getUsers()
   
   This can cause production bugs. Let's pair program tomorrow to
   review defensive programming patterns. I'll share some resources too."
```

## Difficult Conversations

### When Performance is Below Expectations

#### Early Intervention (Week 1-2)

**If intern is struggling:**

1. **Identify the issue**
   - Technical skills gap?
   - Time management?
   - Communication?
   - Personal issues?

2. **Have honest conversation**
   - "I've noticed [specific behavior]"
   - "This is concerning because [impact]"
   - "How can I support you?"

3. **Create action plan**
   - Specific improvements needed
   - Timeline for improvement
   - Additional support offered
   - Check-in schedule

4. **Document conversation**
   - Date and summary
   - Action items agreed
   - Follow-up date

#### Mid-Program Intervention (Week 2-3)

**If issues persist:**

1. **Escalate to Program Lead**
   - Share documentation
   - Discuss options
   - Get guidance

2. **Formal improvement plan**
   - Written expectations
   - Clear timeline
   - Daily check-ins
   - Possible outcomes

3. **Consider alternatives**
   - Extended internship?
   - Different role/project?
   - Early conclusion?

### Sample Difficult Conversation Script

```
"[Name], I wanted to talk with you about your progress. Over the past
two weeks, I've noticed [specific issues]:

1. [Issue 1 with example]
2. [Issue 2 with example]
3. [Issue 3 with example]

This is concerning because [impact on learning/team/project].

I want to understand what's happening from your perspective. What

## FAQ for Mentors

**Q: How much time should I spend mentoring?**
A: 6-9 hours per week on average. More in Week 1-2, less in Week 3-4 as intern becomes independent.

**Q: What if my intern is struggling?**
A: Intervene early. Have honest conversation, create action plan, escalate to Program Lead if needed.

**Q: How strict should I be in code reviews?**
A: Balance learning and quality. Explain the "why" behind feedback. Don't nitpick, but don't approve bad code.

**Q: What if I'm too busy to mentor well?**
A: Communicate early. We can adjust workload or assign backup mentor. Intern success is priority.

**Q: How do I give negative feedback?**
A: Use SBI model. Be specific, kind, and constructive. Focus on behavior, not person. Offer solutions.

**Q: What if intern asks questions I don't know?**
A: It's okay to say "I don't know, let's figure it out together." Models problem-solving.

**Q: Should I do work for the intern?**

**Q: How do I balance being friendly and professional?**
A: Be approachable and supportive, but maintain professional boundaries. You're mentor first, friend second.
